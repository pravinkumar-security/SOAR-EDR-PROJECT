# üõ°Ô∏è SOAR‚ÄìEDR Project | LimaCharlie + Tines + Slack Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of **LimaCharlie (EDR)** and **Tines (SOAR)** to automate incident response workflows.  
It simulates a real-world detection-to-response pipeline, where execution of malicious tools (e.g., LaZagne) on an endpoint triggers automated alerts and responses across Slack and Email, with optional machine isolation.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used
- LimaCharlie (Endpoint Detection & Response)
- Tines (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
- Windows 10 VM (Endpoint on VirtualBox)
- Slack (Alerting & Collaboration)
- Email Notifications
- PowerShell (Testing malicious execution)

## üß© Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Endpoint Setup
- Installed **LimaCharlie agent** on a Windows 10 VM using the installation key.
- Verified connectivity between endpoint and LimaCharlie cloud dashboard.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Detection Rule in LimaCharlie
- Created a **custom detection rule** to identify execution of the tool `lazagne.exe` via PowerShell.
- Configured event forwarding from LimaCharlie ‚Üí Tines.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ SOAR Automation with Tines
- Integrated LimaCharlie with Tines via the **detection feed**.
- Built a **Tines Playbook** to handle incoming alerts:
  - Forward alerts to **Slack** channel.
  - Send **email notifications**.
  - Prompt the user with a **Yes/No option** to isolate the machine.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Response Actions
- **If user selects YES** ‚Üí endpoint is isolated from the network.  
- **If user selects NO** ‚Üí no isolation action, but an alert is logged.  
- In both cases, Slack is updated with the action taken.
